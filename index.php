        <p>Book Bin is a good initiative by our Commerce Department. I hope everyone will get benefit from this. This mark the end of a problem which students of Morigaon have been facing for a long time. This site will work as a medium for students who want to buy and sell used books and other study-related material in the easiest way. It will also be helpful for the financially weaker students. At last, I thank the creator team for their efforts and wish everyone all the best.</p>
